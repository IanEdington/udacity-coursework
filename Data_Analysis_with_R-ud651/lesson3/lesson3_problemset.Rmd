  How many observations are in the data set? : 53940
  How many variables are in the data set? : 10
  How many ordered factors are in the dataset? : 3 (cut, colour, clarity)
  What letter represents the best colour for a diamond? : D

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(diamonds)
nrow(diamonds) # Number of observations
summary(diamonds) # Variables in dataset
?diamonds # Ordered Factors, Best Colour
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

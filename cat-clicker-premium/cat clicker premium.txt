reflections:
How hard was the project?
	3/5
How do you feel about your code?
	Good! I knew what I wanted it to do and I figured it out. If you wanted 100 cats, it would take a while to find all the pictures but that would be the hardest part!
How many times have you clicked the cats? probably 200 times in total. Got to make sure they were working properly :D


Project Requirements for Cat Clicker Premium

Visuals

The application should display

a list of at least 5 cats, listed by name
an area to display the selected cat
In the cat display area, the following should be displayed

the cat's name
a picture of the cat
text showing the number of clicks
The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.
Interaction

When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.

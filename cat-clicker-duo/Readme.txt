Udacity wrap-up (2015 May 15):
    How hard was it? Hard but not impossible.
    How do you feel about your code? Good, I made use of the Sudo-Classical style to greatly reduce the code duplication. It was hard but worth the effort.

New Project Requirements for Cat Clicker

The application should display two cats. Each cat includes
the cat's name
a picture of the cat
text showing the number of clicks
The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.
Interaction

The number of clicks should increment when each cat picture is clicked.
